The early days of planning the wedding are both exciting and alarming. We had lots of fun dreaming up our vision for the day but then had a hard crash back to reality when we had to start planning how to bring our vision to life and consider the realities of our budget….

It was really worthwhile spending a lot of time on this stage and allowed us to plan an event we were both happy with and that we could afford. We made sure to get all our ideas and requirements recorded from the outset so that we didn’t forget anything over the months ahead. Everyone has their own tools, but here is what we used to start planning our day:

Creating the vision for our wedding day was definitely my favourite part of the planning process. It was the time where we let our imagination run free and I was able to release some pent-up creativity I had. As with most people in 2017/18 we primarily used Pinterest to save all our favourite ideas and to create the Vision Board to set the mood for our day.

Before you start your board my main piece of advice to to remember that the wedding is both of your day. If you don’t want to bear the burden of planning the wedding alone then it is important to start as you mean to go on and ensure at this stage you develop the vision and plan for your day together. We all know it’s easy to lose motivation to do something that you either don’t like or don’t feel is necessary and so make sure you are listening to each other and be open to new ideas. From my experience, developing a vision together and making compromises will ensure that both parties retain interest and enthusiasm throughout the planning stage.

We started our Board with an open mind and both pinned random images that we liked rather than sticking to a particular fixed theme.  It was a very valuable exercise, and by creating the Board together, we were able to compile ideas that ensured our day was unique and reflected us a couple. I have to admit this was difficult for me as I had a strong image of how I wanted my wedding to be.  Sam had never thought about the components of a wedding before this point, and so it would have been easy for me to just present my ideas to him but this would have denied him the fun part of the planning process.Sam actually ended up developing some pretty strong opinions on venue designs, which led to some tensions but meant that we ended up with a really special day we were both proud of.

Reviewing the board a theme naturally emerged; we had picked a lot of images with a natural feel, including greenery, outdoor weddings and indoor trees. This woodland theme then underpinned the majority of our decisions relating to planning the event for ease of ensuring compatibility of individual components and to create a clear and memorable identity for our day.

Once we had developed our vision we started to get to the serious side of early stage wedding planning: budgeting and setting out tasks. We used Google Sheets to create a shared budget tracker and Trello to set out actions and progress. These applications are available to use on all your devices and so they are easy to keep track of, update and collaborate.

We started our budget by setting out each individual component of the wedding and allocating a target budget for it. On Trello we the set out a task card for each component identified on the budget sheet and tracked fee quotes, bookings and follow-up actions to ensure each element was covered. Each wedding is individual, but broadly the main components we planned for were as follows:
- Venue for marriage
- Venue for reception
- Wedding dress
- Groom’s outfit
- Wedding party outfits
- Hair and make-up
- Photography
- Transport
- Flowers
- Food and drinks
- Cake
- Music
- Decorations
- Invitations

Our approach to each of these items is covered in more detail in the next section, but needless to say our the cost for each element was much higher than we expected. This meant that some tough decisions has to be made to keep within budget. For us it was important to identify our must haves which we were willing to allocate more budget to as required and cut down on some nice to haves as we progressed with the planning process.
