      <p>Sam proposed to me on an isolated beach on the west coast of Scotland on 26th August 2017. We were married less than a year later on 11th August 2018 in the Scottish Borders. Our budget wasnâ€™t big enough for a wedding planner and so we decided to plan it all ourselves. Living over 360 miles away in London, it was challenging to plan a wedding so far away but it was all worth it for our dream day.</p>

      <p>Our wedding exceeded my expectations in every way. We had an incredible day full of fun and dancing and I am incredibly proud of what me and my partner (and many helpers!) put together. The year that preceded the wedding was exciting, challenging, inspiring and stressful and so I wanted to prepare this record of everything we did to plan the wedding. Once I wrote it I decided to make it public in case it might be useful to anyone planning their own wedding.</p>
